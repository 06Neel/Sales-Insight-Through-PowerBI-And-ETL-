# Sales Insight Through PowerBI And ETL

Sales Insight Through PowerBI And ETL is a project that aims to provide meaningful insights into sales data using PowerBI and an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. It allows businesses to analyze and visualize their sales data to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.

## Features

- **ETL Process**: Perform Extract, Transform, Load operations to process raw sales data from various sources and prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Integration**: Integrate sales data from multiple sources, such as databases, CSV files, or APIs, into a unified dataset.
- **Data Cleansing**: Cleanse and preprocess the sales data to ensure data quality and accuracy.
- **Data Transformation**: Perform data transformations and calculations to derive meaningful metrics and indicators for sales analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Design a robust data model that enables efficient analysis and visualization in PowerBI.
- **PowerBI Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI to visualize sales performance, trends, and key metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize a variety of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to present sales insights in an intuitive and informative manner.
